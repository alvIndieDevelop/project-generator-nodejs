# Nodejs project generator cli

this project have many templates to make the development a little more fast, and stop re-write and configuring.
I will add more templates for now are only 3.

1. create-react-app: this just run the npx create-react-app
2. create-react-app-typescript: this just run npx create-react-app --template typescript
3. create-react-app-redux-mui-react-router-i18n: is a create-react-app but configured to have redux (@reduxjs/toolkit), i18n for Internationalization, buildplate for react-router-dom and @mui the library component [@mui](https://mui.com/)

# Steps

1. run - npm run build -
2. to use the cli anywhere need to register "generator" as a comand line interface, run - npm link
3. to remove - npm -g uninstall generator

# TODO

- make a better description
- add more templates
